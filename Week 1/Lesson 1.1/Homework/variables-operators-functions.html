		//EXERCISE 1
		//1. Ask the user for their age.

		const years = prompt("What is your age?");
		
		//2. Store the answer and convert their age into seconds.
		const seconds = 60;
		const minutes = 60;
		const hour = 24;
		const day = 30;
		const month = 12;
		const ageInSeconds = seconds * minutes * hour * day * month * years;
		//3. Log into the console their age in seconds.
		console.log(ageInSeconds);
		//4. Try concatenating the answer into a sentence: Your age in seconds is --.
		console.log(`Your age in seconds is: ${ageInSeconds}`);

		//EXERCISE 2
		//1. Create 3 variables that asks the user for three numbers.

		//2. Use a function to find the minimum of the three.
		function findMaxMin(){
			const num1 = parseInt(prompt("Enter number 1: "));
			const num2 = parseInt(prompt("Enter number 2: "));
			const num3 = parseInt(prompt("Enter number 3: "));
			console.log("The minimum number is: " + Math.min(num1, num2, num3));
		

		//3. Log the answer into the console using the sentence: The maximum number is --.
			console.log(`The maximum number is ${Math.max(num1, num2, num3)}`);
		}

		// EXERCISE 3
		// Write some code that finds the youngest person out of three ages.

		function findMaxAge(){
			const num1 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person 1: "));
			const num2 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person 2: "));
			const num3 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person 3: "));
		
		// Log into the console the sentence: The youngest person is -- years old.
			console.log(`The youngest person is ${Math.min(num1, num2, num3)} years old`);
		}

		// EXERCISE 4
		// Write some code that returns a random number between 1 and 100.
			const random = Math.floor(Math.random()*100) + 1;
		// Log into the console the sentence: Your random number is --.
			console.log(`Your random number is ${random}`);
		// Bonus points for returning a whole number (no decimals).
    	// Hint: Look into Math.random and Math.round

		// EXERCISE 5
		// Write some code that adds sales tax to a price.
			const price = prompt("Price of item is: ");
			const taxRate = 1.08;
		// Log into the console the sentence: "The total price with tax is $--."
			const total = price * taxRate;
			console.log(`The total price with tax is $ ${total.toFixed(2)}.`)
		// Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)
