    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold the user input from the prompt.
    const food = prompt("What is your favorite food?");

    // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // "My favorite food is -----." using the answer from the prompt
    console.log(`My favourite food is ${food}.`);

    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0.
    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,

    let count = 0;
    count +=1;

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."
    console.log(`I baked a cookie. Now I have ${count} cookie.`);

    // Create a variable that holds a random number between 0 and 100. 
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*101); //add one to make sure it can get to 100
    console.log(randomNumber);

    // add that new number to the cookie count 
    count = count + randomNumber;

    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.

    count = count - 1;

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
    console.log(`I just ate a cookie. Now I have ${count} cookies left.`)
